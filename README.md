# DeepRLcourse_HF

### What this repo contains:   
1. My code from following the HuggingFace Deep Reinforcement Learning course
2. (Eventually) My own side-projects, completed inline with this course  

Free course link: https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction

### How to run:  
1. Setup virtual environment (https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter0/1?fw=pt)
2. Fight VSCode to allow the selection of your virtual environment
3. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt` or in my case `$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Didn't you do Machine Learning at uni?  
Yes, I did. But I thought speed-running a course would be a fun way to refresh my skills.
